# CV

Welcome to my personal CV webpage! This site showcases my professional journey, technical expertise, and 
some of the cool projects I had the opportunity to work with as an AI engineer and as a theoretical physicist researcher
in academia. 

## About Me

I am an experienced AI engineer with deep expertise in artificial intelligence, software development,
and high-performance computing (HPC), gained from both academia and the private sector. I have led
numerous projects in machine learning, and I frequently serve as a technical lead, translating complex
business challenges into innovative AI solutions. Proficient in Python, C++, and CUDA GPGPU programming,
I have a proven track record of delivering impactful AI-driven projects.

## Expertise and Interests:

I am passionate about various fields of Machine Learning, particularly Deep Learning, Bayesian Machine Learning, 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) and surrogate models to speed up complex physics simulations. 
I am also interested in leveraging large language models (LLMs) and transformers in areas such as Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation (RAG), generative AI for engineering design, and techniques like Imitation Learning or Behavioral Cloning.
