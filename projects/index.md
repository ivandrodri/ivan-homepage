## Innovative GPU-Based Milling/Collision Simulator

### The Challenge  
The milling process involves a **sequential dependency**:  

At each time step $$t = j$$, the material shape depends on all previous steps ( $$t = 0$$  to  $$t = j-1$$ ) .
To compute collisions: 

- The simulation runs **sequentially**, leading to a complexity of $$ O(N) $$, where $$ N \sim 10^6 $$ for complex shapes.

**Even with parallel collision detection at a single time step, the sequential nature remains a bottleneck**.

### Existing Solutions  

CAM software typically computes collisions in **time windows**:

- ‚úÖ Speeds up simulations.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks **false positives** for collisions.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Produces **suboptimal tool paths**, relying on CAM programmer experience to avoid potential issues.

### Our Solution

We developed an **innovative, fully parallelizable approach** using a **reduction operation/error-correction method**:  

- Transforms the sequential \( O(N) \) problem into a **fully parallel** one with complexity \( O(\log N) \).  
- Implemented entirely on the **GPU** for maximum performance.
- EU/USA patents granted

### Key Features  
- üöÄ **Fully GPU-Accelerated**: The milling/collision simulator runs completely inside the GPU.
- üß© **Two-Voxelization Model**:  
   - Saves **local milling and collision data** for the work-piece.  
   - Optimizes calculations to achieve parallel processing efficiency.
   - For the two voxelization model we implemented the method developed in the paper 
     [Fast parallel surface and solid voxelization on GPUs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1882261.1866201) . 
     For a simple version of the voxelizer give a look to my [repo]()

This method significantly reduces simulation time while ensuring **accurate, collision-free tool paths**. 

BONUS: 

Leverage this high-speed simulator to **optimize toolpaths** further using advanced techniques, such as 
**Reinforcement Learning**, to enhance performance and accuracy even more.
