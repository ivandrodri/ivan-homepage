## CNC milling/collision simulation.
![Screenshot of project](assets/images/project1.png)

The main idea of the project was to create a very fast milling/collision simulation in a manufacturing process as you
can see in the figure below.


The main issue is that the shape evolves in time during manufacturing and to compute collision detection sequentially 
is a huge bottleneck. So many CAM software's instead computes the collision in time windows were the workpiece (i.e. the
material being milled)
