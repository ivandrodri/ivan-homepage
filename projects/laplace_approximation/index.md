# Bayesian Deep Neural Networks

These are part of my notes on Bayesian methods, specifically focusing on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) using 
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) in [pyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro) and the Laplace 
approximation using both, pyro and the [Laplace](https://github.com/aleximmer/laplace) library. 

Below, you'll find a link to a Jupyter Book notebook containing a practical exercises and to theoretical explanations.
Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
