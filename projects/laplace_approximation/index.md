# Bayesian Methods

These are part of my notes on Bayesian methods, specifically focusing on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) using 
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) and the Laplace approximation. Below, you'll find a link to a Jupyter Book 
notebook containing both practical exercises and theoretical explanations.
