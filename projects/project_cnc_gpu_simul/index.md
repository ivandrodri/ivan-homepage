# Innovative GPU-Based Milling/Collision Simulator üöÄ

---

## The Challenge üòü

The milling process involves a **sequential dependency**:

At each time step ```t = j```, the material shape depends on all previous steps  ```t = 0``` to ```t = j - 1```).

**To compute collisions**: A typical simulator runs sequentially, leading to a complexity of ```~O(N)```, where 
```N ~ 10^6``` for complex shapes.

Even with parallel collision detection at a single time step, the **sequential nature remains a bottleneck**. üòî

---

## Existing Solutions üõ†Ô∏è  

CAM software typically **computes collisions at specific time windows** to speed up the simulation:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks **false positives** for collisions.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Produces **suboptimal tool paths**: To avoid potential collisions, CAM programmers often prioritize safety over 
  efficiency, leading to suboptimal paths. Additionally, **significant time is wasted visually inspecting for potential 
  collisions** during time windows.

---

## Our Solution üí°

We developed an **innovative, fully parallelizable algorithm** using a **reduction operation/error-correction method**:  

- Transforms the sequential problem into a **fully parallel** one with complexity ```O( log N)```.  
- **Implemented entirely on the GPU** for maximum performance.
- **EU/USA patents granted** 

**Our Approach**:

- üöÄ Achieves **significant speedup through full-time parallelization** using CUDA cores and stream parallelism.
- üöÄ **Enables more optimal tool paths**, allowing CAM programmers to focus on path optimization. Collisions are flagged 
  automatically, specifying the exact time and location of the issue. 

To implement our algorithm, **we have developed a milling and collision simulation from scratch using CUDA/C++** for 
high-performance computations and a simple rendering visualizer built with **VTK**.

## Simulation Overview üõ†Ô∏è  
Our simulator employs a **two-level voxel model**:  
- **L1**: Coarse-grained voxelization for efficient broad-phase detection (big blue voxels).  
- **L2**: Fine-grained voxelization for detailed collision resolution (small withe voxels).

Check out the video below to see it in action! üé• . Here, a 5-axis CNC machine demonstrates collision detection, 
with collisions highlighted in **red voxels**.

The video demonstrates a simple example with a relatively large L2 voxel size for demonstration purposes. 
However, **our simulator is capable of handling much more complex cases**, such as the one shown below:

<div class="lightbox-image">
    <img src="../../assets/img/henhis_face.png" alt="Complex milling/collision simulation">
</div>


- **~4 million toolpath positions** simulated on a **laptop with an RTX4060 GPU (8GB)**.  
- Two-level voxel model:  
  - **L1:** 20x20 voxel layer.  
  - **L2:** 30x30 voxel layer with a **0.1 mm voxel size**.  
- Same 5-axis CNC machine as in the video.  

We leverage **CUDA stream parallelization** for further improved single GPU parallelization performance, achieving the 
following speed-ups:

- **1 stream: 344499 milliseconds**  
- **2 streams: 202646 milliseconds**   
- **4 streams: 198754 milliseconds**   

> **Note:** In this example, only the **tool holder** is used for collision detection to manage GPU memory. 
> If the GPU is overloaded with the full mesh data of all machine surfaces, as this is a small GPU, 
> the limited resources (e.g., CUDA cores and memory) would force streams to execute sequentially, reducing the 
> benefits of stream  parallelization. This can be seen for 4 streams where the speedup doesn't increase beyond the 
> 2 stream case. Instead, from 1 to 2 streams the speedup is around 1.7. Nevertheless, with **multiple GPUs**, the full 
> simulation (including all machine surfaces) would again demonstrate significant stream parallelization speed-ups.

## Key Features üåü  

---

### Collision Detection  
The simulation leverages advanced techniques to ensure accurate and efficient collision detection:  
- **Rigid body collision detection** for each time step.  
- **GPU-optimized BVH trees** and acceleration techniques to identify potential collision targets.  
- **Primitive shape intersections**, such as **triangle-voxel**, to detect actual collisions:
  - Between machine surfaces and the voxelized workpiece.  
  - Between complex tools and surface primitives.  

---

### Optimization Strategy  
Our approach focuses on **time-parallelization**, avoiding traditional bottlenecks:  
- Unlike traditional CAM solutions that optimize collision detection (a sequential bottleneck), our method 
- **parallelizes across time steps**.  
- We refine the **time-parallelization algorithm** for maximum efficiency.
- The algorithm can use multiple GPUs but also multiple streams within a single GPU for task parallelism in order to
  speed up our time parallel simulation.

To implement the two-level voxelization, we adopted the method from the paper 
[Fast parallel surface and solid voxelization on GPUs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1882261.1866201). For a simplified version (single-level voxelization), 
check out my [voxelizer repo](#).

### Template Metaprogramming with CUDA/C++ üí°  

To achieve a clean, object-oriented design while adhering to the **SOLID principles** at the CUDA level:

- We use **template metaprogramming** to mimic **dependency injection** at compile time.
- This approach eliminates runtime overhead while maintaining performance and flexibility.

The code looks like this:

Given the interface `ITwoLevelVoxelModel`, we use the implementation `TwoLevelModelSimple`, as shown in the examples 
above. This is the voxel model for the workpiece.

```cpp
typedef ITwoLevelVoxelModel<TwoLevelModelSimple> VoxelModel;
```

`IMillingArchitecture` is the interface associated with the parallelization type, such as multiple GPU time 
parallelization (`MillingParallelNcMultiGpu`), which uses our algorithm, or a time-sequential one (`MillingSerialNc`), 
as done in standard CAM software.

``` cpp
typedef IMillingArchitecture<MillingParallelNcMultiGpu, VoxelModel> MillingArch;     
//typedef IMillingArchitecture<MillingSerialNc, VoxelModel> MillingArch;   
```

`IMachineKinematics` defines the kinematics of the machine. In the example above, we used a 5-axis configuration, but 
it could also be a 3+2-axis or 3-axis machine, etc.

``` cpp
typedef IMachineKinematics<FiveAxisKinematics> MachineKinematics;
```

Finally, we create the Machine to run the simulation.

``` cpp
typedef MachineBasic<IMachineKinematics, MillingArch, VoxelModel> MachineBasic;
```

**BONUS:** 

Leverage this high-speed simulator to **optimize toolpaths** further using advanced techniques such as 
**Reinforcement Learning** to enhance performance and accuracy even more. This is still a work in progress (WIP). üòä
